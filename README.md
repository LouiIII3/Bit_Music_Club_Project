  - <b>Workout Beats provides a feature that allows users to adjust the music according to their workout environment.

  <h2>Added part</h2>
1. Token Implementation
  
  - The reason for implementing tokens: 
Token-based registration is utilized to enhance authentication and security, facilitate stateless architecture, separate infrastructure components, improve user experience, and enable consistent authentication across applications.

1-2. Implementing direct login and sign-up functionality in Version 1.
   - The reason for directly implementing the login and sign-up functionalities:
   I opted to implement the login and sign-up functionalities directly, without relying on frameworks like Spring Security, to deepen my understanding of the underlying concepts and operational principles.

   - By exploring various security and authentication techniques firsthand, I aimed to broaden my understanding of different technologies, contributing to making better decisions regarding technology stacks.
